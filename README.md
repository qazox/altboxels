# altboxels
**This repository is outdated. New version: https://git.qazox.dev/derv/altboxels**

A sandbox game inspired by ht?ps://sandboxels.r74n.com/, with a cleaner codebase and secure/simple modding support in mind.

Some of the elements are derived from other games in the falling sand genre, especially Sandboxels. However, the physics engine and other backend code are custom and independently developed.
